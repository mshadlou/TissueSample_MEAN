> You must have npm package manager and nodeJs already installed in your platform

## Goals

1. Display a list of collections on the home page (including their title and associated disease).
2. Drill into a collectionâ€™s record to view the details of their currently associated samples.
3. Add a new sample to an existing collection.
4. Create a new collection.
5. Pagination for the table
6. Deploy in the cloud

This demo has been developed by MEAN Stack.

## Front-end
Front-end has been implemented using AngularJs and Bootstrap. `dashboard.ctrl.js` manages the controller for `dashboard.html`. It shows the tables, response to search query, `GET` or `POST` requests to the Back-end with the help of `dashboard.svc.js`; an AngularJS service. Application controller is `application.ctrl.js` and it controls `index.html` and all associated tasks such as toasting a notification to user etc. By separting the `dashboard.ctrl.js` and `application.ctrl.js` and seting up the `routes.js`, we are able to expand the functionality in the future and maintenace will be easier. <br>
To handle 404, 403, and 500 messages, three htmls are directed by Rouprovider in `routes.js`.<br>
In addition to `Bootstrap 5.x`, I have developed a `style.css` serving additional functionality such as notification toatsers, dropdown menu, header, etc.

## Data Schema
MongoDB has been used as NRDBMS and a free Atlas account has been created to store the data. `db.js` manages the connection to the cloud-based NRDBMS. It is a free-shared service for a demo only. Two Schemas have been defined: (1) Collection, (2) Sample.

```javascript

var Collection = db.model('Collection',{
	id:{type:Number, required: true, default: 1 },              // collection id
	disease_term: {type : String, required : true},             // disease terminology
  title: {type : String, required : true},                    // title
  date:{type : Date, required : true, default : +new Date()}  // updated date  
});

var Sample = db.model('Sample',{
	id:{type:Number, required: true, default: 1 },              // sample id
	c_id: {type : Number, required : true},                     // collection id
  donor_count: {type : Number},                               // donor count
	mat_type: {type: String},                                   //material type
  date:{type : Date, required : true, default : +new Date()}  // updated date
})

```
Username and password for aformenetioned collections are as follow:
Username: TissueSampleDB <br>
Password: UniversityNottingham{2022}<br>
Link for connection to MongoDB Compass is `mongodb+srv://TissueSampleDB:UniversityNottingham{2022}@cluster0.kbrljqd.mongodb.net/TissueSampleDB`

## API Design - `RERTful Design Convention`

#### GET - `/getCollection/:p_id/:MaxPerPage`

This will return the Collections according to PageNumber (`p_id`) and maxuimum number of rows in each view (`MaxPerPage`). Output does also specify whether the next/previous page is also available or not.

#### GET - `/searchCollection/:query`

This will return the `Collections` according to the `query` requested.

#### POST - `/CRUDcollection`

This `Post` RESTFul API processes the request and received data and carries out all CRUD operations on `Colllection` model. It will also return a message to the user.

#### GET - `/searchSample/:query`

This will return the `Samples` according to the `query` requested.

#### POST - `/CRUDsample`

This `Post` RESTFul API processes the request and received data and carries out all CRUD operations on `Sample` model. It will also return a message to the user.



## Automation tool
Gulp is a JavaScript task runner for improving front-end and back-end development workflow. With the use of a number of gulp plugins I have automated repetitive tasks such as minification, compilation etc and composed them into efficient build pipelines.
### Tasks
The following list of tasks is preconfigured in gulpfile.js file:
1. `gulp-sourcemaps`: It automatically creates source maps from the code; usefull for debugging minified Angular apps in the browser.
2. `gulp-concat`: To concatenate the javascript with sourcemaps, it is employed.
3. `gulp-ng-annotate`: Add angularjs dependency injection annotations with ng-annotate.
4. `gulp-trim`: to trim methods/properties in JS files.
5. `gulp-minify`:  It helps automate copying files, and minifying JavaScript code. 
### To run the development mode

```bash
npm dev
```

## Cloud
### Heroku
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, deliver, monitor, scale and run applications entirely in the cloud.
I have enabled the integration between Heroku and GitHub. Check the demo in following link.
